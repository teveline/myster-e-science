  <h1 class="header">Welcome to Myster E. Science!</h1>
  <h1 class="schoolLogo"></h1>
  <p>Welcome to my 8th grade science page! I've been teaching Middle School Science and Integrated Physics and Chemistry (IPC) for over 5 years and have gathered and created quite a bit of resources that I would like to share with students and fellow teachers
    alike. This site will initially cover 8th grade science material, but I will update and add IPC Materials in the future and perhaps 7th and 6th grade material as well. It covers material that is needed for the 8th grade STAAR test.</p>

    <!-- Insert the paragraph that you wrote for the google site that you cant find or write your own if you can't find it -->
      <p class="information"> What are things made of? Well from fifth grade, you may have learned the answer to this question is: <em>Matter!</em> Things are made of matter. Stuff.</p>

      <p class="information">If you were to take your pencil or the device you're reading this on and break it down into the smallest pieces possible, you would find tiny bits of matter called <strong>atoms</strong>.</p>

      <p class="information">The same way a sand castle is made of tiny bits of sand, matter is made of these atoms, including the sand in this example.</p>

    <p class="information">You will notice that the atom above has two major areas. The <strong>Nucleus</strong>, which has its own two parts, and the <strong>electron cloud</strong> shown here as a blue cloud surrounding the nucleus. If you look at one of those atoms, you'll see that even the tiniest bits of matter also have parts.</p>

      <p class="information">All atoms, no matter what kind only have three types of things in them each of which are differentiated by their <em>size</em>, <em>location</em> and <em>charge</em> inside the
        atom. These three things are called <strong>Protons</strong>, <strong>Electrons</strong>, and <strong>Neutrons</strong>.</p>

    <p class="information">There are currently 118 different types of atoms, known as <strong>elements</strong> which we keep organized on the periodic table. Each one has a different number of protons, electrons, and neutrons.</p>
    <img class="image" src= "https://sciencenotes.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KidsPeriodicTable2017.png" alt= The Periodic Table>
    <p class="information">Each one of those boxes in the periodic table can be used to make a model of an atom just like the one that we saw above. We can also use the periodic table to figure out what type of atom we are looking at. Here is how:</p>
    <img class="image" src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/916whatisatomicmass-090916100012-phpapp01/95/what-is-atomic-mass-5-728.jpg?cb=1253095274" alt= Element box>
    <p class="information">Each one of those boxes on the periodic table tells you a bit of information, such as the name of the element. That name may be written out, for example, "Oxygen", "Carbon", "Gold", or "Iron", but its <strong>Symbol</strong> (O, C, Au, or Fe) will also be listed. We often use the symbol of an element to reperesent it, rather than writing out the entire name every time.</p>
    <p class="information">Each symbol has one capital letter and maybe a second lowercase letter. Be careful, some lowercase letters like l (L) can look like a capital i (I). Check the periodic table to make sure.</p>
    <img class="image" src="https://www.learner.org/interactives/periodic/images/table_box_1.jpg" alt= Atomic Number>
    <p class="information">You may have also noticed the two numbers in the element box. Those two numbers represent one or more of the different parts of an atom.</p> 
    <p class="information">The top number is the most important because it is what we use to determine which type of atom it is. It is called the <strong>Atomic number</strong>, and it tells you <em>the number of protons</em>. That's right, the only difference between a Carbon atom, or an Oxygen atom, or an atom of gold is the number of protons it has.</p>

    <p class="information">The bottom number in the element box, which may appear as a decimal, is the amount of objects (particles) inside of the nucleus. It is the amount of <em>protons and neutrons added together</em>, because that's what is inside the nucleus.</p>
    <img class="image" src="http://ykonline.yksd.com/distanceedcourses/Courses/PhysicalScience/Lessons/FirstQuarter/Chapter03/Lesson05/AtomSizeComarison.jpg" alt="Size of Protons, Neutrons, and electrons">
    <p class="information">You may have noticed in the previous pictures that Protons and Neutrons are not only the same size, but they are much, MUCH larger than electrons. Electrons are SO small, that we pretty much pretend like they're not even there when we are trying to figure out how much <em>matter an atom has in it</em>, or its <strong>mass</strong>). All of the mass in an atom is inside of its nucleus. So this bottom number is called the <strong>Atomic Mass</strong>.</p>
    <img class="image" src="http://slideplayer.com/4216438/14/images/16/H+1+Step+1+Atomic+Mass+1.00794+Hydrogen+1.00794+1.jpg" alt= "How to round the atomic number">
    <p class="information"><em>Hint: Remember to round the atomic mass because it is an average. Not all atoms of the same element (type) have the same number of neutrons. This can make two different atoms of carbon, for example, have different atomic masses (called <strong>Isotopes</strong>). Round the decimal to the nearest whole number in front of the decimal. An example of how to do this is above:</em></p>
    <img class="image" src="https://www.ontrack-media.net/chemistry/cm2l5image1.jpg" alt= The Atomic Mass>
    <p class="information">In this example 28.086 is rounded to just 28. Silicon has an atomic mass of 28!</p>
    <p class="information">From those two numbers in the element box we can actually find out how many <strong>protons</strong>, <strong>electrons</strong>, and <strong>neutrons</strong> are inside of each and every atom. The number of protons come from the atomic number. The number of neutrons is hiding in the <strong>atomic mass</strong> number. (Subtract the atomic mass and atomic number to get the number of protons.) Lastly, in most atoms, your number of <strong>electrons</strong> is the exact same as your number of protons. So the number of electrons can also be found in the <strong>atomic number</strong>, just like the number of protons. When they are not the same an atom is instead called an <strong>ion</strong>.</p>

        <h3 class="title">8.5B Atom Identity and Reactivity</h3>
        <p class="information">Because there are over 100 types of atoms, when trying to determine what model of an atom you're looking at, you only need to look at one thing: <em>the number of protons</em>. Protons are what determine what type of element an atom is, even though there are also neutrons and electrons in the atom as well. Protons are the <strong>ONLY</strong> thing that determines identity. For example, if an atom has 2 protons it is Helium. The number of neutrons and electrons don't matter here, because that same atom can have different numbers of both
          and still retain their properties.
          <p>
            <p class="information">One reason why we care about different elements is because different substances behave differently. On an atomic level, the thing that determines that is the number of electrons in the last or outer energy level (also known as shells, or rings).
              These electrons are special and have their own name. They are called <strong>Valence electrons</strong>. Atoms generally want to have as many electrons in their outer shell as will fit and will give away, take or borrow electrons to get
              a complete outer shell. Also the closer they are to having this full <em>valence</em>, or outer shell the more <em>reactive</em> they are. These atoms are more likely to participate in chemical reactions.</p>

      <h3 class="title">8.5C Periodic Table Structure</h3>
        <p class="information">For centuries, people have been pulling this "stuff" out the ground and measuring its properties. In the past two hundred years or so we found a pretty good way to organize these elements and their properties into an easily readable chart called the periodic table.
        </p>
     </div>

     <div id="85d">
       <h3 class="title">8.5D Counting Atoms and Molecules</h3>
          <p class="information">While there are only a little over a hundred different types of atoms. There are millions upon millions of different substances! That's because most atoms aren't found in their elemental form here on Earth where we find them. They are usually combined together in groups called <strong>Molecules</strong>. Molecules are two or more atoms that are chemically combined together.</p>

           <p class="information">In the sand castle example we used earlier, we discussed how a sand castle is composed of sand. But when you look closer at sand you may notice that its made of many different types of substances. One of those substances is called <em>silica</em>, or silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub)>. Silicon dioxide is an example of a molecule. It is made of three different types of atoms: one atom of silicon and two atoms of oxygen that are combined together by sharing their valence electrons.</p>
